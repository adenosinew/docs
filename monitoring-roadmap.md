# Monitoring Roadmap for NS-3 Simulation Environment

**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** 2025-07-31
**Context/Purpose:** This document outlines a phased roadmap for establishing a comprehensive monitoring infrastructure for the NS-3 simulation environment on AWS. The goal is to provide deep visibility into both the underlying infrastructure and the NS-3 application, enabling performance optimization, troubleshooting, and cost management.

## Executive Summary

This roadmap details a three-phased approach to implementing a production-grade monitoring solution using Prometheus, Grafana, and VictoriaMetrics. 
- **Phase 1** establishes foundational infrastructure monitoring for the cluster.
- **Phase 2** introduces advanced infrastructure and storage monitoring, including cost analysis.
- **Phase 3** implements detailed, high-frequency monitoring specific to the NS-3 application and MPI performance. 
This approach will provide actionable insights to improve simulation efficiency, reduce costs, and accelerate development cycles.

## Problem Statement / Opportunity

Currently, we lack a centralized and detailed monitoring system for our NS-3 simulation clusters. This results in several challenges:
- **Difficulty in troubleshooting:** When simulations are slow or fail, it is difficult to determine whether the cause is in the infrastructure (CPU, memory, network) or the NS-3 application itself.
- **Inefficient resource utilization:** Without detailed metrics, we cannot effectively right-size our AWS instances, leading to unnecessary costs.
- **Lack of performance visibility:** We cannot track the performance of NS-3 simulations over time, making it difficult to identify regressions or measure the impact of optimizations.
- **Reactive problem-solving:** We can only react to problems after they occur, rather than proactively identifying and addressing potential issues.

By implementing a comprehensive monitoring solution, we have the opportunity to significantly improve the performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of our NS-3 simulation environment.

## Goals and Tenets

**Goals:**
- To achieve comprehensive visibility into the health and performance of the NS-3 simulation environment.
- To enable proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.
- To optimize resource utilization and reduce AWS costs.
- To provide developers with the data they need to improve simulation performance.

**Tenets:**
- **Data-backed decisions:** All performance and optimization decisions will be supported by metrics.
- **Customer-focused:** The monitoring solution will be designed to meet the needs of the NS-3 developers and researchers who use the simulation environment.
- **Automation:** The monitoring infrastructure will be deployed and managed using automation to ensure consistency and reduce manual effort.

## Detailed Analysis and Options

The proposed solution is based on a modern, open-source monitoring stack that is well-suited for high-performance computing environments:
- **Prometheus:** For collecting and storing time-series data.
- **Grafana:** For visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.
- **VictoriaMetrics:** For long-term storage and high-performance querying of metrics.
- **Node Exporter:** For collecting system-level metrics from each node.
- **Process Exporter:** For monitoring NS-3 and other critical processes.
- **Custom Exporters:** For collecting application-specific metrics from NS-3.

This stack was chosen for its scalability, flexibility, and extensive ecosystem of integrations. The following phased implementation plan will allow us to incrementally build out the monitoring solution, delivering value at each stage.

## Recommendation

We recommend proceeding with the following three-phased implementation plan.

### Phase 1: Basic Cluster Infrastructure Monitoring

**Objective:** Establish a baseline of monitoring for the core infrastructure of the simulation cluster.

**Key Actions:**
1.  **Deploy Prometheus and Grafana:** Set up a central Prometheus server for scraping metrics and a Grafana instance for visualization.
2.  **Install Node Exporter:** Deploy the Node Exporter on all nodes in the cluster to collect essential system metrics, including:
    - CPU utilization
    - Memory usage
    - Disk I/O
    - Network statistics
3.  **Create Basic Dashboards:** Develop Grafana dashboards to visualize the key metrics collected in this phase.
4.  **Implement Basic Alerting:** Configure basic alerts in Prometheus to notify the team of critical infrastructure issues, such as high CPU usage or low disk space.

**Success Metrics:**
- All nodes in the cluster are reporting metrics to Prometheus.
- Grafana dashboards are providing a clear overview of cluster health.
- Alerts are successfully triggered for simulated infrastructure issues.

### Phase 2: Advanced Infrastructure Monitoring

**Objective:** Enhance the monitoring capabilities to include more advanced infrastructure metrics and cost analysis.

**Key Actions:**
1.  **Deploy Process Exporter:** Install the Process Exporter to monitor the resource usage of specific processes, including the NS-3 simulator and MPI.
2.  **Integrate AWS CloudWatch Metrics:** Use the CloudWatch exporter to pull in AWS-specific metrics, such as EBS burst balance and network performance.
3.  **Implement Storage Monitoring:** If applicable, deploy the Lustre exporter to monitor the performance of the Lustre filesystem.
4.  **Add Cost-Monitoring:** Use a cost exporter to track AWS costs associated with the simulation environment.
5.  **Advanced Alerting:** Create more sophisticated alert rules for issues like high CPU steal time, memory pressure, and network bottlenecks.

**Success Metrics:**
- Detailed resource usage for NS-3 and MPI processes is available in Grafana.
- AWS-specific metrics are integrated into dashboards.
- Lustre filesystem performance can be monitored in real-time.
- AWS costs are tracked and visualized.

### Phase 3: NS-3 Application Monitoring

**Objective:** Implement detailed, high-frequency monitoring of the NS-3 application to provide deep insights into simulation performance.

**Key Actions:**
1.  **Develop Custom NS-3 Exporter:** Create a custom exporter to expose application-level metrics from NS-3, such as:
    - Simulation time and event processing rate
    - Packet transmission, reception, and drop rates
    - Buffer occupancy and drops
    - MPI communication statistics
2.  **Implement High-Frequency Monitoring:** Utilize a multi-tier scraping strategy and the Push Gateway for sub-second metric collection for critical events.
3.  **Set up Long-Term Storage:** Deploy VictoriaMetrics for long-term storage of high-resolution metrics, with a tiered retention policy.
4.  **Create NS-3 Performance Dashboards:** Build detailed Grafana dashboards for analyzing NS-3 and MPI performance, including communication patterns and scaling efficiency.
5.  **Application-Specific Alerting:** Configure alerts for NS-3 specific issues, such as stalled simulations, MPI load imbalance, and high packet drop rates.

**Success Metrics:**
- A rich set of application-level metrics from NS-3 is available for analysis.
- High-frequency metrics provide detailed insights into critical simulation events.
- Long-term performance trends can be analyzed using VictoriaMetrics.
- Dashboards and alerts enable proactive optimization of NS-3 simulations.
