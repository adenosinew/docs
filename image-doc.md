## **1. Title and Context**

- **Title**: Image Doc: A Strategy for Building and Managing AWS AMIs
- **Author(s)**: [Your Name/Team]
- **Date**: {current_date}
- **Context / Purpose**: This document defines a standardized, automated strategy for building, securing, distributing, and managing Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). The goal is to establish a secure and efficient "golden image" pipeline that provides consistent, up-to-date, and secure base images for all our EC2-based services.
- **Background**: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a master image used to create virtual servers (EC2 instances) in AWS. Our current process for creating AMIs is largely manual, which introduces risks related to security, consistency, and deployment velocity. A robust AMI management strategy is critical for cloud operational excellence.

## **2. Executive Summary**

*A concise summary of the entire document. This section should be written last.*

This document proposes a shift from manual AMI creation to a fully automated, infrastructure-as-code pipeline using tools like HashiCorp Packer and a CI/CD service (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins). We analyze the drawbacks of our current approach and evaluate three options for the future. We recommend adopting a Packer-based pipeline, which will treat our machine images as version-controlled artifacts. This strategy will significantly improve our security posture by enabling automated patching and vulnerability scanning, increase deployment speed, and ensure consistency across all environments, reducing configuration drift and "snowflake" servers.

## **3. Problem Statement / Opportunity**

Our current ad-hoc approach to AMI management presents several significant challenges:

- **Security Risks**: Manually-built images often start from outdated base AMIs. The process for patching and updating system packages is inconsistent, leaving potential vulnerabilities in our production environments.
- **Inconsistency and "Configuration Drift"**: Without a single source of truth, different teams and environments use slightly different base images. Manual changes to running instances that are later turned into AMIs lead to "snowflake" servers that are impossible to reproduce accurately.
- **Slow and Inefficient**: The manual process of launching an instance, configuring it by hand, and creating an image is slow, tedious, and error-prone. This becomes a bottleneck for application deployment and patching.
- **No Traceability**: We lack a clear, auditable trail of what software versions, configurations, and scripts were used to build a specific AMI.

The opportunity is to create a secure, efficient, and reliable factory for producing machine images. This will make security a foundational, automated part of our infrastructure and empower development teams to move faster with confidence.

## **4. Goals and Tenets**

### **Goals**
- **Automation**: Achieve 100% automation in the AMI build, test, and validation process.
- **Immutability**: Treat images as immutable artifacts. To change a running system, a new image is built and deployed, replacing the old one.
- **Security**: Bake security into the pipeline. Every image must be automatically scanned for vulnerabilities and hardened before being approved for use.
- **Traceability**: Every AMI must have a clear, version-controlled history of its contents and build process.
- **Velocity**: Reduce the time to produce and roll out a patched or updated AMI from days to hours.

### **Tenets**
*(We will incorporate our broader engineering tenets later.)*

## **5. Detailed Analysis and Options**

We consider three primary options for our AMI management strategy.

### **Option 1: Manual Creation (Status Quo)**

- **Description**: Engineers manually launch an EC2 instance from a base AWS AMI, apply updates and install software via SSH, and then create a new AMI from the running instance.
- **Pros**: Very low barrier to entry for simple, one-off tasks.
- **Cons**: Not scalable, highly error-prone, insecure, slow, and impossible to audit effectively. This is the source of our current problems.

### **Option 2: AWS-Native with EC2 Image Builder**

- **Description**: Use EC2 Image Builder, a managed AWS service, to automate the creation of AMIs. We would define build components and an image pipeline within the AWS console or via CloudFormation.
- **Pros**:
    - Fully managed service, reducing operational overhead.
    - Integrates seamlessly with other AWS services (e.g., Inspector for scanning, KMS for encryption).
    - Provides built-in testing and validation steps.
- **Cons**:
    - Can introduce vendor lock-in to the AWS ecosystem.
    - Less flexible than code-based tools for complex, multi-tool, or multi-cloud build processes.

### **Option 3: Infrastructure-as-Code with Packer and CI/CD**

- **Description**: Use HashiCorp Packer to define our AMIs declaratively in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). These Packer templates are stored in Git and executed in a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Pros**:
    - **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Enables GitOps workflows, including pull requests for peer review of image changes.
    - **Cloud-Agnostic**: Packer can build images for multiple platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), providing future flexibility.
    - **Highly Customizable**: Full control over the build process, allowing integration with any scripting or configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef).
- **Cons**:
    - Requires us to build and maintain the CI/CD pipeline.
    - Steeper initial learning curve compared to a managed service UI.

## **6. Recommendation**

We strongly recommend **Option 3: Infrastructure-as-Code with Packer and CI/CD** as our strategic direction.

- **Why**: This option aligns perfectly with our goals of automation, immutability, and traceability. By treating our images as code, we gain the ability to version, review, and audit all changes. Packer's flexibility and agnosticism are key strategic advantages that will serve us well in the long term, even if our cloud strategy evolves. The benefits of a fully-controlled, auditable software supply chain for our images outweigh the overhead of managing the pipeline.
- **Implementation Plan**:
    1. **Q3**: Develop and version-control Packer templates for a common "base" AMI.
    2. **Q3**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions that triggers on commits to the Packer repository.
    3. **Q4**: Integrate a security scanner (e.g., Trivy) into the pipeline to fail builds with critical vulnerabilities.
    4. **Q4**: Define an AMI lifecycle and distribution policy (e.g., automatically share approved AMIs with other AWS accounts and deprecate old ones).
    5. **Q1 Next Year**: Document the new process and begin onboarding application teams.
